# Extensions for the Rad framework.

- face - tools for rapid interface creation.
- common_interface - common user interface for Rad.
- rad_ext - additions and extensions of the Rad.
- rad_js - JS plugin for the Rad.
- rad - Rapid Application Development tool built upon of the Rad.

Please go to specs for docs.

P.S.
All these components will be in standalone gems, but right now it's simpler for me to hold all of them in one place.
