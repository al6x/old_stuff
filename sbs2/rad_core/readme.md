# Rad - Toolkit for building Network Application in Ruby.

It's a toolkit, not framework. It doesn't force You to use some prdefined architecture, but instead gives You instruments to build Your own.
It also encourages to build application as a set of cooperating components instead of monolith.

Some **sites built with Rad Toolkit**:

Classic **sample blog app** [rad-sample.heroku.com](http://rad-sample.heroku.com) (it's hosted using free Heroku instance and sometimes it takes about 10sec to start up, so please be patient) sources  [github.com/alexeypetrushin/rad_sample](http://github.com/alexeypetrushin/rad_sample)

## Goals and Vision behind

- Divide and rule (build app as a set of cooperated components).
- True support for OOP (models, controllers, polymorphic routes).
- Simple things should be simple (simple API, instant start).
- Complete control if You need it, it's designed to be open and customizable.
- Agile development should be easy (specs, iterative development, fast prototyping).
- Code base should be small and simple.

## It's small

Take a look at [code statistics](http://ruby-lang.info/blog/simple-approach-to-measure-the-agility-and-complexi-4mu), find there the 'rad_core' word and compare its size with others.

I believe **small code size is very important**, it means that the project is easy to understand, easy to refactor and customize and its agile (by agility I mean high speed of reaction and adoption to changing world environment and requirements).
