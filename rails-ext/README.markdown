# Ruby on Rails extensions.

* Abstract Interface: Tool for rapid web interface creation, see [Common Interface][common_interface] - concrete realisation of Abstract Interface
* MongoMapperExt: MongoMapper extensions, Migration, Query Profiling in Log, Attributes Cache, Default Scope, BelongsTo Counter Cache
* Sunspot: Sunspot support for MongoMapper
* rails_ext - a lots of Rails hacks, mainly to add inheritance support (because there's no OOD and inheritance in Rails by default).

All these extensions should be different gems itself but right for me it's easier to deal with all of them in one place, later I'll split them.
