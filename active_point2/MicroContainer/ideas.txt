LOW
----
- Add ability to work in multi concurrent threads per session (via synchronization per session)
- Add aliases to scopes
- Add hierarchical scopes
- Single-thread per session (and then i'll can use continuations, and have more clear MicroContainer architecture)

DONE
- change 'include Managed' to 'extend Managed'
- Reimplement AsyncObserver
- Document it
